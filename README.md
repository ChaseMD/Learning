# Learning

Repository for all of my learning material in software development & computer science. Most of the code is from following project tutorials on Youtube from channels including Traversy Media, freeCodeCamp, and others with some changes. The projects cover the basics, how-to solutions for common web features, and some advanced topics like data structures and algorithms in JavaScript.
 __Assume that all projects and code in this repo is not my own. This is to show what I have been learning recently.__ 

## Goal: daily commits of my learning progress

## Current Learning Focus:

1. Advanced HTML/CSS
2. Basics of JavaScript
3. Using advanced HTML/CSS and vanilla JavaScript to build common website features without libaries or frameworks
4. Accessibility
